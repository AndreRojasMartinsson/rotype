# RoType

This is a very badly written piece of library
that for now works as expected.

I'd probably not recommend you use this, it's simply a
hacky mess created for a project where I needed better runtime
type checking than what `@rbxts/t` could provide.

If you wish to fix, or cleanup the code feel free to do so however
that is completely optional since I probably won't touch the code for the
near future.
